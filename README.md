Introduction 

The objective of this project is to replicate the google homepage as best as possible with HTML/CSS. This project will also test my knowledge of git and github.

Reflection

Overall, the google homepage I replicated seems to look identical to the actual webpage. Some things i should look further in to is the box shadow that appears when hovering over the search bar. Also, I should research how to position icons within the search bar.
